## Project Background

This project analyzes the impact of minimum wage changes on consumer behavior, specifically focusing on calorie consumption and basket scores (a measure of nutritional quality). The study uses a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to assess the effects on treated and untreated groups over time.

## Problem Statement

Previous research has suggested that changes in minimum wage policies can influence consumer purchasing behavior, particularly in food choices. This study investigates:

Whether minimum wage increases affect calorie consumption.

The impact on basket scores as a proxy for nutritional quality.

How these effects vary across regions and time.

## Key Questions

How does a minimum wage increase affect calorie consumption?

Does basket score behavior differ between treated and untreated groups?

Are there observable parallel trends between groups before treatment?

## Data Overview

The dataset includes detailed records across multiple states with attributes such as:

ID: Unique identifier for each observation

Group: Indicates whether the observation belongs to the Minimum Wage or Control group

Year & Month: Time periods for tracking pre- and post-treatment outcomes

Calories: Number of calories consumed in each observation

Basket Score: A measure of nutritional quality

## Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Created treatment period and group identifiers.

Descriptive Analysis: Summarized data across key variables.

Parallel Trends Analysis: Examined pre-treatment trends to assess validity of the DiD approach.

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis: Measured treatment effects on calories and basket score.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated significance of key coefficients to confirm causal relationships.

## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Impact of Minimum Wage on Calories

The DiD model revealed that while calorie consumption initially decreased in the treatment group, the impact was not statistically significant.

### 2. Impact on Nutritional Quality (Basket Score)

The DiD model highlighted a small but positive improvement in basket scores for the treatment group post-treatment.

### 3. Parallel Trends Analysis

Parallel trends were confirmed before the treatment period, validating the DiD approach.

### 4. Staggered Difference-in-Differences Analysis

Additional analysis incorporating staggered treatment periods showed consistent patterns, reinforcing key findings.

## Conclusion

The analysis found minimal evidence of a significant reduction in calorie consumption following minimum wage increases. However, there was some improvement in basket scores, suggesting a slight shift toward better nutritional choices. The study underscores the complexity of linking economic policy to consumer behavior.

## Recommendations

Conduct further research with a longer observation period to capture delayed consumer responses.

Incorporate household income data to improve the modelâ€™s explanatory power.

Evaluate other dietary metrics such as sugar content and food category preferences for a comprehensive analysis.
